     <p>The best team in the world.</p>
     <p>Teachers, apparently, reasoned the same way as Hermione. They literally overwhelmed the students with homework, and therefore the Easter holidays, compared to the Christmas holidays, were completely unhappy. Yes, and how can you relax when next to you Hermione aloud repeats twelve ways to use the blood of a dragon or works out the technique of movements of a magic wand. Yawning and moaning with displeasure, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library, trying to simultaneously repeat what they had learned and learn new things.</p>
